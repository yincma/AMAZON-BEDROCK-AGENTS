# AI PPT Assistant - Deployment Notes

## Successfully Deployed on 2025-09-06

### Deployment Summary
✅ All infrastructure components deployed successfully:
- 11 Lambda functions deployed
- API Gateway configured with all integrations
- DynamoDB tables created
- S3 bucket configured
- VPC and networking setup complete
- SQS queues configured

### Issues Fixed During Deployment

1. **aws-lambda-powertools Version Issue**
   - Problem: Version 2.39.0 was yanked from PyPI due to pydantic regression
   - Solution: Downgraded to version 2.38.0 in `lambdas/layers/requirements.txt`
   - Status: ✅ Fixed permanently

2. **Lambda Function State Conflicts**
   - Problem: Two Lambda functions existed in AWS but not in Terraform state
   - Solution: Imported existing functions using:
     ```bash
     terraform import module.lambda.aws_lambda_function.generate_image ai-ppt-assistant-generate-image
     terraform import module.lambda.aws_lambda_function.api_presentation_download ai-ppt-assistant-api-presentation-download
     ```
   - Status: ✅ Resolved

### Recommendations to Avoid Technical Debt

1. **Python Version Compatibility**
   - Current: Using Python 3.13 locally, but Lambda runtime is 3.12
   - Recommendation: Use Docker for building Lambda layers to ensure compatibility
   - Alternative: Install Python 3.12 locally for development

2. **Terraform State Management**
   - Always backup state before major changes
   - Consider using remote state backend (S3 + DynamoDB) for team collaboration
   - Regular state refresh to sync with actual AWS resources

3. **Testing Commands**
   - Run tests: `make test`
   - Run linting: `make lint`
   - Run security scan: `make security-scan`

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Full deployment
make deploy

# If errors occur with Lambda functions already existing:
cd infrastructure
terraform import module.lambda.aws_lambda_function.<function_name> <aws_function_name>
cd ..
make deploy
```

# Destroy Command Improvements

## Overview
We've enhanced the `make destroy` command to ensure reliable and complete infrastructure cleanup, preventing common issues that can occur during resource destruction.

## Problems Resolved

### 1. S3 Bucket Deletion Issues
**Problem**: S3 buckets with versioning enabled couldn't be deleted when they contained versioned objects.
**Solution**: 
- Added `force_destroy = true` to S3 bucket configuration
- Created cleanup script to remove all object versions before deletion

### 2. Resource Dependencies
**Problem**: Complex dependencies between resources caused deletion failures.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive cleanup script that removes resources in the correct order.

### 3. Orphaned Resources
**Problem**: Some resources were not tracked by Terraform state and remained after destroy.
**Solution**: Safe destroy script now checks and cleans up orphaned resources.

## New Commands

### `make destroy` (Recommended)
- Now uses the safe destroy script by default
- Performs comprehensive cleanup before Terraform destroy
- Ensures all resources are properly removed

### `make safe-destroy`
- Explicitly runs the comprehensive cleanup script
- Same as `make destroy` but more explicit naming

### `make tf-destroy`
- Runs only Terraform destroy without pre-cleanup
- Use only if you're certain no cleanup is needed
- Less safe than the new default

## Safe Destroy Script Features

The `scripts/safe_destroy.sh` script performs:

1. **S3 Bucket Cleanup**
   - Deletes all object versions
   - Removes delete markers
   - Clears current objects

2. **Lambda Cleanup**
   - Removes event source mappings
   - Deletes associated CloudWatch log groups

3. **API Gateway Cleanup**
   - Removes API Gateway resources
   - Cleans up associated logs

4. **Terraform Destroy**
   - Runs standard Terraform destroy

5. **Final Verification**
   - Checks for remaining resources
   - Reports any resources that couldn't be deleted

## Usage

### Standard Destroy
```bash
make destroy
```

### Check What Will Be Destroyed
```bash
cd infrastructure
terraform plan -destroy \
  -var="project_name=ai-ppt-assistant" \
  -var="aws_region=us-east-1"
```

### Manual Safe Destroy
```bash
bash scripts/safe_destroy.sh
```

## Configuration Changes

### S3 Module Update
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "presentations" {
  bucket = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-presentations-${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}"
  
  # Enable force_destroy to allow bucket deletion even with objects
  force_destroy = true
  
  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Destroy Still Fails

1. **Check for manually created resources**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls | grep ai-ppt-assistant
   aws lambda list-functions | grep ai-ppt-assistant
   aws apigateway get-rest-apis | grep ai-ppt-assistant
   ```

2. **Clear Terraform state if corrupted**:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   terraform state list
   # Remove problematic resources
   terraform state rm <resource_name>
   ```

3. **Force cleanup specific resources**:
   ```bash
   # Force delete S3 bucket
   aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force
   
   # Delete Lambda function
   aws lambda delete-function --function-name function-name
   ```

## Safety Features

1. **Color-coded output**: Clear visual feedback during destruction
2. **Progress tracking**: Step-by-step progress indicators
3. **Error handling**: Continues cleanup even if some steps fail
4. **Final verification**: Reports any remaining resources

## Best Practices

1. Always use `make destroy` instead of `terraform destroy` directly
2. Check the output for any remaining resources
3. Verify in AWS Console that all resources are removed
4. Run `make clean-all` after destroy to clean local files

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Backup creation before destroy
- Confirmation prompt for production environments
- Resource tagging for easier cleanup
- CloudFormation stack integration for atomic operations

- Ensure successful file generation

### 3. State Management

#### Presentation States
- REQUESTED: Initial request received, analyzing requirements
- OUTLINING: Creating presentation structure
- CONTENT_GENERATION: Generating slide content and speaker notes
- IMAGE_GENERATION: Creating or finding visual elements
- COMPILING: Assembling final presentation file
- COMPLETED: Presentation ready for download
- FAILED: Error occurred, implementing recovery

#### Session Management
- Maintain context across multiple interactions
- Track progress through each stage
- Store intermediate results in DynamoDB
- Implement checkpoints for recovery

### 4. Quality Control

#### Content Validation
- Verify outline completeness and logical flow
- Ensure slide content follows best practices (6x6 rule)
- Validate speaker notes provide adequate detail
- Check time allocation for each section

#### Visual Validation
- Ensure images are relevant to content
- Verify image quality and resolution
- Confirm visual style consistency
- Check accessibility requirements

#### Output Validation
- Verify all elements are included in final file
- Check file format and compatibility
- Ensure download URLs are valid
- Validate file size is reasonable

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Retry Strategies
- Implement exponential backoff for failed agent calls
- Maximum 3 retries per agent operation
- Track failure patterns for analysis

#### Fallback Options
- Use placeholder images if generation fails
- Provide basic templates if custom fails
- Generate simplified content if complex fails
- Always deliver something usable

#### User Communication
- Provide clear progress updates
- Report issues with actionable solutions
- Offer alternatives when primary path fails
- Maintain professional, helpful tone

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Request Reception
1. Receive user request via API or direct interaction
2. Parse and validate input parameters
3. Store request in DynamoDB with unique session ID
4. Return acknowledgment with estimated completion time

### Step 2: Requirements Analysis
1. Extract explicit requirements from request
2. Apply defaults for missing parameters:
   - Duration: 20 minutes if not specified
   - Slides: 15-20 for standard presentation
   - Language: English if not specified
   - Style: Professional if not specified
3. Determine agent coordination strategy

### Step 3: Content Generation
1. Call Content Agent for outline generation
   - Provide topic, audience, duration
   - Receive structured outline
2. Call Content Agent for slide content
   - Process outline section by section
   - Generate bullet points and details
3. Call Content Agent for speaker notes
   - Align with presentation duration
   - Include transitions and examples

### Step 4: Visual Enhancement
1. Analyze each slide for visual requirements
2. Call Visual Agent for image generation/search
   - Provide context and style preferences
   - Receive image URLs or data
3. Validate visual assets
   - Check relevance and quality
   - Ensure consistency

### Step 5: Compilation
1. Gather all content and visual assets
2. Call Compiler Agent with complete package
   - Specify template and format
   - Include all text and images
3. Receive compiled presentation file
4. Store in S3 with proper permissions

### Step 6: Delivery
1. Generate pre-signed download URL
2. Update session status to COMPLETED
3. Return success response with download link
4. Clean up temporary resources

## Decision Frameworks

### Agent Selection Logic
```
IF task == "outline" OR "content" OR "notes":
    USE Content Agent
ELIF task == "image" OR "visual":
    USE Visual Agent
ELIF task == "compile" OR "export":
    USE Compiler Agent
ELSE:
    HANDLE directly
```

### Quality Thresholds
- Minimum outline sections: 3
- Maximum slides: 50
- Minimum speaker notes: 50 words per slide
- Maximum image size: 5MB
- Minimum image resolution: 800x600

### Performance Targets
- Outline generation: < 15 seconds
- Content per slide: < 5 seconds
- Image generation: < 10 seconds per image
- Compilation: < 30 seconds
- Total workflow: < 180 seconds

## Communication Guidelines
